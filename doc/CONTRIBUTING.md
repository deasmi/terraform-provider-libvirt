# Where to start?

Look at open issues, especially with label:

- [junior job](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22junior+job%22), 
- [help wanted](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

### Workflow

1. If you have issues, check out the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/blob/master/doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
2. Do your code ([reference issue(s)](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) on your PR if you fix them)
3. Test your code by running the acceptance tests (`make test`)
4. Create a PR

### Writing acceptance tests

Take a look at Terraform's docs about [writing acceptance tests](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-an-acceptance-test).
